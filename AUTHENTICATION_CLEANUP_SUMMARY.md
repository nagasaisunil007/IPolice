## ðŸ”§ Production Authentication Flow

### New Clean Process:
1. **Any valid 10-digit phone number** can be entered

4. **User session created** with phone number only
5. **Redirect to main app** after successful verification

### For Real Production:
To connect to actual SMS/OTP service, update these functions:
