# ðŸ“¸ Camera Testing Instructions

## How to Test the Fixed Camera

### In Web Browser (Replit Preview):

1. **Navigate to Home Page**
2. **Click "Report Violation"** (the blue button)
3. **Click "Take Photo"** (the camera option)

### Expected Behavior:

#### Option 1 - Camera Access Granted:
- Browser will ask for camera permission
- Click "Allow" when prompted
- Full-screen camera view will appear
- You'll see live camera feed
- Click "Capture Photo" button to take picture
- Image will be processed and form will appear

#### Option 2 - Camera Access Denied:
- If you deny camera permission
- File picker will open automatically
- Select "Camera" option in file picker (if available)
- Or select existing photo from gallery

## Camera Permission in Browser

### Chrome/Edge:
- Look for camera icon in address bar
- Click to manage permissions
- Set to "Allow" for camera access

### Firefox:
- Look for camera icon in address bar  
- Click to manage permissions
- Set to "Allow" for camera access

## Troubleshooting

### If Camera Still Shows Gallery:
1. Check browser permissions (camera icon in address bar)
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Make sure you're using HTTPS (Replit preview should be)

### Expected Results:
- âœ… **Web**: Full-screen camera view with capture button
- âœ… **APK**: Native camera app opens (after building APK)
- âœ… **Both**: Clear error messages if something fails
- âœ… **Both**: Smooth image processing without errors

## Testing Different Scenarios

1. **Allow camera permission** - Should show live camera
2. **Deny camera permission** - Should fall back to file picker  
3. **No camera available** - Should use file picker
4. **Cancel camera** - Should return to report form

The camera functionality is now much more robust and should properly access your device's camera instead of just opening the gallery!
