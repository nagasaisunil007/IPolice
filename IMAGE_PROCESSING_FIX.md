# Image Processing Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
The "Failed to process captured image" error has been resolved by implementing a more robust base64 to File conversion method.

## Root Cause
The previous `fetch()` method for converting base64 data to blob was failing due to:
- Browser security restrictions with data URLs
- Async fetch operations timing out
- Malformed base64 data format

## Solution Implemented
Replaced `fetch()` with direct base64 to blob conversion:

```typescript
// OLD (problematic):
const response = await fetch(imageData);
const blob = await response.blob();

// NEW (reliable):
const base64Data = imageData.split(',')[1] || imageData;
const byteCharacters = atob(base64Data);
const byteNumbers = new Array(byteCharacters.length);
for (let i = 0; i < byteCharacters.length; i++) {
  byteNumbers[i] = byteCharacters.charCodeAt(i);
}
const byteArray = new Uint8Array(byteNumbers);
const blob = new Blob([byteArray], { type: 'image/jpeg' });
```

## Benefits
- More reliable conversion process
- No dependency on fetch API for data URLs
- Better error handling with fallback options
- Works consistently across browsers
- Handles both web camera and file input scenarios

## Files Updated
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx` - Fixed image processing in startCamera()
- `client/src/pages/report.tsx` - Fixed image processing in startCamera() and selectFromGallery()

The image capture and processing should now work without conversion errors in both web and APK environments.
