# ✅ Web Camera Issue Fixed

## Problem Resolved
The "Failed to process captured image" error in the web application has been fixed.

## Root Cause
The previous web camera fallback was trying to use `getUserMedia()` with video streams, which often fails due to:
- Browser security restrictions
- Device permissions
- Camera access limitations in development environment

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the complex video stream approach with a simple, reliable file input method:

```typescript
// OLD (problematic):
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })
  .then(stream => {
    // Complex video/canvas processing
  })

// NEW (reliable):
const input = document.createElement('input');
input.type = 'file';
input.accept = 'image/*';
input.capture = 'environment'; // Prefer camera if available
input.click();
```

## How It Works Now

### In Web Browser:
1. Click "Take Photo"  
2. File picker opens with camera option
3. Select photo from camera or gallery
4. Image processes correctly
5. Proceeds to form step

### In APK:
1. Click "Take Photo"
2. Native camera app opens
3. Take photo with native camera
4. Image processes correctly
5. Proceeds to form step

## Benefits
- ✅ More reliable across all browsers
- ✅ Better mobile compatibility  
- ✅ Simpler error handling
- ✅ No browser permissions issues
- ✅ Works with both camera and gallery

## Testing Results
